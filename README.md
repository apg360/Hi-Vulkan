# VulkanKore

VulkanKore is the foundation step 0, libraries :
* [GLFW : the multi-platform library for window context and input (keyboard, mouse, gamepad input)](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
* [Volk : the Vulkan meta loader](https://github.com/zeux/volk/)
* [V-EZ : the Vulkan wrapper library](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/V-EZ)
* [dlg : the logging library]()
* [mathc : the simple math library for 2D and 3D programming](https://github.com/felselva/mathc)
* [vector](https://github.com/goldsborough/vector)
* [vector for typed lists](https://github.com/swenson/vector.h)

/*\ Just the bare minimum to have vulkan starting and drawing a triangle+cube (if possible make it rotating)
No customization or anything special, just the same routine everyone needs to write to have Vulkan start and running.
