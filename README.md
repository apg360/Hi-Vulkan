# VulkanKore
 [GLFW : the multi-platform library for window and input](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) + [Volk : the Vulkan meta loader](https://github.com/zeux/volk/) + [V-EZ : the Vulkan wrapper library](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/V-EZ)

0_VulkanKore : **>The foundation :: glfw, volk, V-EZ, dlg logging, mathc, vector
window context & keyboard, mouse, gamepad input

/*\ Just the bare minimum to have vulkan starting and drawing a triangle+cube (if possible make it rotating)
No customization or anything special, just the same routine everyone needs to write to have Vulkan start and running.
